Its time to reflect upon the work that has gone in making 2023 a satisfying year of
updates for this website.

## Content Management

Last year, I started building my website using `contentlayer` to manage the mdx content.
It was definitely great DX to manage content with full type safety. But, as of writing
this, contentlayer is not maintained. And I was looking for tools that would be reliable
and scalable.
Then I found out that team behing Next.js has taken the opportunity to release `@next/mdx`
which natively provides MDX support in Next.js.

I was immediately interested in using it for my next blog refresh. While the documentation
around `@next/mdx` could be better, but I don't mind getting my hands dirty and discovering
the nitty-gritty details. I am sure my design isn't the best out there, but I am still happy
with the amout of functions I could achieve with just this one package. No `contentlayer`,
or `remark-frontmatter`, or `gray-matter`, just some copy pastable javascript code and node.js.

I am excited to share how I leveraged `@next/mdx` to eliminate these dependencies.

### contentlayer

The first and possibly the biggest of the dependencies that I removed.

I use `getAllFrontmatter` helper to parse all mdx files and then leverage `@next/mdx`
to read the frontmatter. I have seen some devs read mdx source and parse the frontmatter
line-by-line. It works, but I prefer to take this approach.

```ts
import glob from "glob";
import type { MDXModule } from "mdx/types";

import type { Frontmatter } from "~/types/frontmatter";

const ROOT_DIR = process.cwd();

export const getAllFrontmatter = async (
  dataDir: string,
  contentDir = "",
): Promise<Frontmatter[]> => {
  const mdxFilePathPattern = `${ROOT_DIR}${dataDir}${contentDir}/**/*.mdx`;
  const mdxFilePaths = glob.sync(mdxFilePathPattern);

  // Resolve all frontmatter promises so we can perform filtering and sorting
  let allFrontmatter: Frontmatter[] = await Promise.all(
    mdxFilePaths.map(async (mdxFilePath) => {
      const modulePath = mdxFilePath
        .replace(`${ROOT_DIR}`, "")
        .replace(`${dataDir}`, "")
        .replace("/page.mdx", "");

      const { metadata } = (await import(
        `/src/data${modulePath}/page.mdx`
      )) as MDXModule;

      return {
        ...(metadata as Frontmatter),
        filePath: mdxFilePath.replace(`${ROOT_DIR}`, ""),
        slug: mdxFilePath
          .replace(`${ROOT_DIR}`, "")
          .replace(`${dataDir}`, "")
          .replace("/page.mdx", ""),
        slugAsParams: mdxFilePath
          .replace(`${ROOT_DIR}`, "")
          .replace(`${dataDir}`, "")
          .replace(`${contentDir}`, "")
          .replace("/page.mdx", "")
          .split("/")
          .slice(1)
          .join("/"),
      } as Frontmatter;
    }),
  );

  // Filter out items where slugAsParams starts with '_'
  allFrontmatter = allFrontmatter.filter(
    (frontmatter: Frontmatter) => !frontmatter.slugAsParams?.startsWith("_"),
  );

  // Sort items by publishedAt in descending order
  allFrontmatter = allFrontmatter.sort(
    (a: Frontmatter, b: Frontmatter) =>
      Number(new Date(b.publishedAt ?? new Date())) -
      Number(new Date(a.publishedAt ?? new Date())),
  );

  return allFrontmatter;
};
```

And `allRoutes` to use all frontmatter in the app, similar to how contentlayer provides.

```ts
import type { Frontmatter } from "~/types/frontmatter";
import { getAllFrontmatter } from "./mdx";

export interface AppRoute {
  label: string;
  pages: Frontmatter[];
}

export type AllRoutes = Record<
  | "projects"
  | "blog"
  AppRoute
>;

export const allRoutes: AllRoutes = {
  projects: {
    label: "Projects",
    pages: [
      ...(await getAllFrontmatter("/src/data", "/projects")).map(
        (page: Frontmatter) => {
          page.icon = "CubeIcon";
          return page;
        },
      ),
    ],
  },
  blog: {
    label: "Blog Posts",
    pages: [
      ...(await getAllFrontmatter("/src/data", "/blog")).map(
        (page: Frontmatter) => {
          page.icon = "FileTextIcon";
          return page;
        },
      ),
    ],
  },
};
```

My MDX files are not as clean as I would prefer them to be, but I am okay with it for now.

Instead of looking like this:

```mdx
---
title: 2023 Website Refresh
description: A satisfying year of updates.
---

Its time to reflect upon the work that has gone in making 2023 a satisfying year of
updates for this website.
```

it looks like this.

```js
export const metadata = {
  title: "2023 Website Refresh",
  description: "A satisfying year of updates.",
};

Its time to reflect upon the work that has gone in making 2023 a satisfying year of
updates for this website.
```

---

to be continued...
