Next.js has a font module load local and google fonts but their documentation isn't clear on how to load **variable local fonts** properly.

I have tried to use [Inter](https://rsms.me/inter) variable font on my website and waned to share how I did it.

```ts showLineNumbers {14} title="font.ts"
import localFont from "next/font/local";

export const fontSans = localFont({
  src: [
    {
      path: "Inter-4.0/InterVariable.woff2",
      style: "normal",
    },
    {
      path: "Inter-4.0/InterVariable-Italic.woff2",
      style: "italic",
    },
  ],
  weight: "100 900",
  display: "swap",
  variable: "--font-sans",
  declarations: [
    {
      prop: "unicode-range",
      value: "U+0020-007F",
    },
  ],
});
```

{<Callout>
Setting the <code>{`weight: "100 900"`}</code> was important here. This is
not documented clearly in Next.js documentation, and without it all my
font weights were being synthesized from single regular weight.

</Callout>}

From here, the documentation is pretty clear. You just add `fontSans.variable` to `className` on `body` tag, prepend `var(--font-sans)` to your `font-family` and you are set.

> The code snippet in this post also uses a `unicode-range`. To read more about it you can read [this post](/blog/subsetting-fonts).
