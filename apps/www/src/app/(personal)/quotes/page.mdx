Chase understanding, not just facts.\
Embrace concepts, not just procedures.\
Cultivate insight, not just information.\
Pursue clarity, not just answers.\
Value reason, not just rules.\
Explore ideas, not just methods.\
Nurture curiosity, not just skills.\
Seek wisdom, not just knowledge.\
Foster creativity, not just techniques.
