## Certifications

<Components.Certifications />

I started my career as a software engineer about **{new Date().getFullYear() - 2016} years ago**. I've tried some programming languages and tech stacks, both back-end, and front-end.

Even though the scope of software and web development is broad, I was primarily focused on **back-end development**.
However, recently I have also started learning more about front-end technologies and designing clean, minimalistic, and modern UI interfaces.

## Back-End Development

I love creating back-ends that are on the bleeding edge of technology, that work reliably, and are highly scalable.

I have enjoyed using **microservices** to create enterprise web applications, including:

- Customer Support Portal
- User Dashboard
- Ecommerce Order Fulfillment Services
- Human Resources Portal
- Usage Reporting Services
- M2M IoT Platform

and others.

## Front-End Development

I am also enjoying making simple web pages like the ones on this website. So, what tools did I use for creating this website?

- React
- Next.js
- RadixUI
- TypeScript

## UI/UX Design

Designing user interfaces is something I want to get into in the long term. While I have been doing back-end design for
a while now, I have not been able to fully express myself in my creations simply due to the fact that I did not know how
to do UI/UX design and develop a front-end interface.

Doing UI/UX design alongside back-end development will finally allow me to create the best possible and complete user
experiences.

The biggest challenge thereafter will be finding the balance between creating a great user interface and an amazing user experience.
