title: Excessive CSS Bundle Size With RadixUI Themes
description: Is there a better way to reduce the css bundle size when using RadixUI Themes?

import { Quote, Text } from "@radix-ui/themes";

import { MDXPageLayout } from "~/components/mdx-layout";

export default function MDXPage({ children }) {
  return <MDXPageLayout metadata={metadata}>{children}</MDXPageLayout>;
}

I love the idea behind [RadixUI Themes](https://www.radix-ui.com/themes).

However, it does add a lot of unused css to the bundle.
I am trying to figure out the best way to axe as much unused css
from the bundle as possible but I have not been able to find an elegant
way to do it so far.

The only way I could reduce some of it was by cloning `@radix-ui/themes`
package into my monorepo and manually removing the unused css imports from it's
css export.

And, it did cut down the overall css bundle by 50% ! Pagespeed also stopped
complaining about unused css.

I know, I know. I am not trying to justify my approach with the results.
It is bad in so many ways. Adds a bunch of maintenance debt which will
eventually be the reason I stop using the dependency in my next annual
website design refresh.

But, I don't like to obsess too much on just reaching the goal.

<Text as="p" size="5" mt="6" mb="6">
  <Quote>The process of how you reach there is just as important.</Quote>
</Text>

So, I am still exploring ways to get this done _more elegantly_ without having
to clone a bunch of code within my monorepo.

If you have any ideas, do [reach out](/contact) to discuss. Any help is appreciated.

Thanks.
