import { Quote, Text } from "@radix-ui/themes";

import * as Components from "./components.tsx";

import { ContentLayout } from "~/components/content-layout";

export default function ContentPage({ children }) {
  return <ContentLayout metadata={metadata}>{children}</ContentLayout>;
}

I have so many things to say, but not all things that can be said need to be said.

Some things, you just experience.

<Text as="p" size="4" mt="6" mb="6">
  {
    <Quote>
      Let them touch you, let them teach you, and then let them never be said.
    </Quote>
  }
</Text>
