## Summary

As an award-winning software engineer with demonstrated history in the tech industry, I bring a blend of backend and frontend development skills to the table. I started my journey at CGI Inc. (Canadian firm with HQ in Montreal) at their Bangalore, India office, where I honed my service oriented architecture and web development skills using Java and Spring, and was awarded for building innovative solution to reduce production downtime during maintenance cycles.

This journey continued at Deloitte Consulting US-India (U.S. firm with HQ in New York) at their Bangalore, India office, where I further enriched my skills with cloud-native technologies such as SpringBoot, Microservices, and on-prem to cloud migrations, outperformed expectations consistently, and was awarded multiple times for my dedication to solving problems, taking up challenges to explore new technologies, developing innovative solutions, and leading the delivery of critical parts of complex enterprise applications.

Beyond my tech persona, I am an avid lifelong learner, consistently upgrading my skills to stay relevant in the ever-evolving tech industry. My certifications in cloud architecture design, setup, and management on AWS, postgraduate certificates in Computer Application Security, and Cloud Computing & Blockchain and my Bachelor's & Master's in Computer Science & Engineering are a testament to this.

I am casually looking for software development roles, where I can leverage my skills and experience to deliver amazing web experiences for users. If you are looking for a tech professional with a knack for building applications for the cloud and an unwavering commitment to excellence, let's connect!

## Skills & Tools

I started my career as a software engineer about **{new Date().getFullYear() - 2016} years ago**. I've tried some programming languages and tech stacks, both back-end, and front-end.

Even though the scope of software and web development is broad, I was primarily focused on **back-end development**.
However, recently I have also started learning more about front-end technologies and designing clean, minimalistic, and modern UI interfaces.

### Back-End Development

I love creating back-ends that are on the bleeding edge of technology, that work reliably, and are highly scalable.

I have enjoyed using **microservices** to create enterprise web applications, including:

- Customer Support Portal
- User Dashboard
- Ecommerce Order Fulfillment Services
- Human Resources Portal
- Usage Reporting Services
- M2M IoT Platform

and others.

### Front-End Development

I am also enjoying making simple web pages like the ones on this website. So, what tools did I use for creating this website?

- React
- Next.js
- RadixUI
- TypeScript
